  description: Raskin Furrywhisker, The Leader of the Cheese-Eaters Alliance and
    Former Prime Minister of Cheeseburg, was forced to flee the country amidst a
    public outcry caused by a massive scandal involving The Cheese pledge policy.
    However, it is important to note that he still holds significant political influence
    within certain groups in your nation. By including him in your cabinet, you may
    be able to gain support from these groups and strengthen your rule. We must take
    into account his past actions, his contributions to the nation, and the current
    political climate. Let us engage in thoughtful deliberation and open dialogue
    to determine the most appropriate course of action for Raskin Furrywhisker now
    that he is back among us. On the other hand, you may also consider the option
    of cutting the hydra's head to consolidate your power and maintain stability.

    a conclusion. '
